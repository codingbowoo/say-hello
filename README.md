     Our App

     Zenly is written mainly in Kotlin with remains of Java but also quite uniquely in Go (we embed a shared library written in Go that deals with stuff like data      synchronization, Network transport and cross-os app feature backends like the Chat or the Location pipeline). Our min SDK is 21 😁
     We make extensive usage of RxJava in structural parts of the app like (lifecycle bound tasks, scheduling, multi-threading, reactive UI model, automated tracing) and have a fair number of internal frameworks built on top of it.
     Last but not least, we try to push Zenly to the edge of the devices capabilities and had much fun making non traditional heavy UI experiences and animations on Android, sometimes heavily tweaking or going beyond what the system normally provides.
